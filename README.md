# 🧠 Machine Learning Models

Welcome to the **Machine Learning Models** repository!  
This project is a curated collection of foundational machine learning algorithms implemented from scratch using Python and NumPy, aimed at deepening understanding of how these models work under the hood.


## 🔍 Overview

This repository is designed for learners and practitioners who want to:

- Understand ML algorithms by building them from the ground up
- Explore mathematical intuition through code
- Strengthen implementation skills for interviews or academic work

No external machine learning libraries (like `scikit-learn`) are used—everything is implemented from scratch using basic Python libraries such as `NumPy` and `Pandas`.
